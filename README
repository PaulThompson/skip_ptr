This is a C++ STL-compatible (I hope) random access iterator.  It wraps a 
pointer and allows you to specify a step value.  Reads from the iterator will
then skip the given number of pointer positions.

My use case is for representing multidimensional matrices as a single linear 
array of values.  I use it to make a wrapper for Matlab mxArray objects for mex
file programming.

I don't have much experience with C++ or STL, so I'm sure there are 
implementation issues with the current draft.  Feel free to report problems to
me or send pull requests.

I tried to develop this based almost entirely on this tutorial:
